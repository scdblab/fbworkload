# fbworkload
This project generates a social networking workload based on published stats by Facebook [1, 2]. Berk et. al [1] provides statistical modelings of key-size, value-size, and inter-arrival gap distributions. Yuehai et. al [2] extends [1] by presenting more analysis results on cache misses.

## Example command to generate a trace. 
trace_specification.properties specifies input parameters. The program writes generated traces to /tmp/fb-trace.
```
java -jar tracegen.jar trace_specification.properties /tmp/fb-trace
```

### Built-in Distributions
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Name</td>
    <td>Distribution</td>
    <td>Value Range</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Key size (bytes)</td>
    <td>Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (location=30.7984, scale=8.20449, shape=0.078688) [1]</td>
    <td>[1, 250]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Value size (bytes)</td>
    <td>Generalized Pareto Distribution (location=0, scale=214.476, shape=0.348238) [1]</td>
    <td>[1, 1,000,000]</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Inter-arrival time (microseconds)</td>
    <td>Generalized Pareto Distribution  (location=0, scale=16.0292, shape=0.154971) [1]</td>
    <td>[1, 1000]</td>
  </tr>
</table>

The sum of probabilities of the above distributions is less than 100% since they impose a maximum limit. We increase the probability for the distributionâ€™s mean such that the sum of probabilities becomes 100%. 

Value size distribution: we use the generalized pareto distribution for the entire value range since the sum exceeds 100% if we include the provided probabilities of the first 14 bytes [1].

The trace is generated with a Zipfian distribution (alpha=100). The following figures show the generated distributions, which resemble CDF graphs of Figure 8 in [1].

## Output
The generated trace is in the following format. 
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Operation</td>
        <td>Key</td>
        <td>Key size (bytes)</td>
        <td>Value size (bytes)</td>
        <td>Timestamp (microseconds)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
Operation is one of:  {READ, REPLACE, DELETE}. This is an example output. It represents a read request on key 10499 at 12 microseconds relative to the first request. The key size is 58 bytes and the value size is 9 bytes.
